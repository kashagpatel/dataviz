<h3>Are more single people cat owners?</h3>

<p> There were more cat owners in the category of people who were married and seeing someone. There were a noticeably higher number of people who were single or identified themselves as available who were dog owners (6,244 owners) over cat owners (5,400 owners).</p>

<h3>About the data</h3>
<p>

The data was scraped from Ok Cupid and provided by researchers who submitted to Journal of Statistical Education. The data file was comprised of 59,943 anonymous profiles including age, relationship status, height, answers to dating questions asked by Ok Cupid, and preferences in smoking, drinking, and pets.</p>

<p>

I decided to look at people's ownership of pets and their relationship status. The choices were 1) has cats, 2) likes dogs and has cats, 3) dislikes dogs and has cats, 4) has dogs, 5) likes cats and has dogs, 6) dislikes cats and has dogs, and 7) has dogs and cats. Because I am interested in people who only own dogs versus who only own cats, I looked at 1-3 for cats, 4-6 for dogs, and disregarded 7.</p>
